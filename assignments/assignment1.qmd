# Guidelines

Use Quarto to complete your assignment. Please provide all the code to make your work reproducible.

### 1. Data structures

**1.1.** Create a new chuck below this text. Then create a vector called `v1` with three elements, where all the elements are characters (i.e., enclosed in single " or double "" quotes). Print the values.

**1.2.** Create a vector `v2` that derives from `v1`, but is of class `factor`. Print the values. Change the order of the levels of the factor (to any random order you want) and print the values.

**1.3.** Create a list `l1` that contains `v1`, `v2` and an additional object of class "data.frame".

### 2. Reading and saving files, accesing elements

### **2.1. Tillage**

Read the file `tillage.csv` from the "data" folder.

**2.1.a.** What is the mean pH value?

**2.1.b.** Create a new column, Tmean, as the average between Tmax and Tmin, and compare it with Tave. Visualize the differences using `hist()`.

**2.1.c.** Which years are contained in this dataset? (Hint: use function `unique`)

**2.1.d.** How many observations are there per year? And per location?

**2.1.e.** How many columns refer exclusively to no-till (i.e. have "NT" in it, but not "CT")? An "soil"?

### 2.2. USDA Census

Read the file `USDAsurvey_00-18.csv` from the "data" folder**.**

**2.2.a.** Create a dataframe that has columns describing: state, county, year, state, average annual yield (US level), average annual yield (state level), and historic standard deviation of yield (state level) (Hint: check out `sd()`).

**2.2.b.** Using the data frame from (**2.2.a.**), which are the states with higher and lower variability in yield? Provide the top 3 of each. What are the environmental conditions in these states?

**2.2.c.** Take the raw dataset (`USDAsurvey_00-18.csv` ) and keep only the rows where the yield is greater than the historical US average.

### 3. Find the error

```{r errs, eval = FALSE}
mtcars %>% # this is a dataset that is included in RStudio 
  rownames_to_column("model") %>% 
  fliter(mpg>15)
```

```{r errs2, eval = FALSE}
mtcars %>% 
  rownames_to_column("model") %>%
  mutate(p = hp/wt)

mtcars %>% rename(Model = model)
```

```{r errs3, eval = FALSE}
mtcars %>% 
  rownames_to_column("model") %>%
  filter(model %in% c(Hornet Sportabout, 
                      Duster 360,
                      Merc 230))
```

### **4. Improve the coding style:**

```{r errs4, eval = FALSE}
1a = mtcars%>%filter(vs!=am&disp<150)  
```

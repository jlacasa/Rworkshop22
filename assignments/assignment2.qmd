## Practice  
Using the N initiative data:   

1. Explore the variability of the data using histograms.

2. Plot Yield versus plant density. Distinguish between states and years using facets and colors.  

3. Read the Site data and characterize the states according to their TOC content.  

4. Using the plant data, plot N content versus growth stage (v5 or v9) for the states with data available.

# Rworkshop22  
Welcome to the 2022 version of this workshop!  
## Motivation and Objectives  
This workshop started in 2021 as a learning environment for visiting scholars at K-State, to learn the basics of R programming and refresh some concepts in applied statistics. Ideally, you will gain skills that will help succeed you in industry/grad school. This workshop is a primer to gain skills in programming and applied statistics.    
**Why R?** R is a a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It will help you reduce (human) error in repetitive tasks, save time with automatization, obtain statistically sond and reproducible results, effective visualizations, and much more.  

While **R** is a programming language, **RStudio** is an IDE (integrated development environment, ~~ "interface"). More on R vs RStudio, [here](https://mgimond.github.io/ES218/R_vs_RStudio.html). More about RStudio [here](https://b-rodrigues.github.io/modern_R/getting-to-know-rstudio.html).  

The objectives of this 2-3 month workshop are to introduce the R environment to the user, along with the tidyverse workflow. By the time you finish, you should be able to master the concept of "tidy data" and know the basics of a data analysis workflow, i.e., (I) download/read the data, (II) perform an exploratory data analysis and do data wrangling, (IV) perform statistical analyses using simple linear models and linear mixed effects models, and (V) interpret and present the results with effective visualizations.
